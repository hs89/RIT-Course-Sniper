Created this ruby script because my unmet needs for course registration have not been met in the past month.

Sniper.rb will prompt for username and password and course number

After providing the necessary info, it checks the open/close course list and checks for a free spot in the desired course every 3 seconds

If there is a free space in the course, it logs into SIS using your provided info and registers the course through the quick add/drop form

Example use case: If someone is playing with their schedule and drops their spot in a full course for at least 3 seconds, this script steals their spot.

Enjoy!
